# failover_2_wan
Failover for 2 Wan

If you have one ISP for Normal WAN and one ISP for FON WAN/VoIP, you can use this script so that in case of a failure, both WANs will run over the working ISP. The script switches automatically when the ISP is back online. 

Notifications about the status change can be received via TelegramBot or Discord webhook.
